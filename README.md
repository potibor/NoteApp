## Architecture

- Single Activity
- MVVM Pattern

**View:** Renders UI and delegates user actions to ViewModel

**ViewModel:** Can have simple UI logic but most of the time just gets the data from UseCase

**UseCase:** Contains all business rules and they written in the manner of single responsibility principle

**Repository:** Single source of data. Responsible to get data from one or more data sources
